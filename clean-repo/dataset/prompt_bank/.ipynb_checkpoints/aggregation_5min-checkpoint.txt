The Cluster Resource Usage dataset is a critical indicator for understanding resource consumption patterns in large-scale computing environments. This dataset consists of 5-minute interval data collected throughout May 2019. To explore the granularity on the Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting (LSTF) problem, the dataset is structured to include: Granularity Levels: Data is recorded at a 5-minute level for precise analysis of resource usage trends. Data Points: Each data point contains the following key features: Target Value: "CPU rate," representing the total CPU usage aggregated across the cluster. Additional Feature: "Canonical memory usage," indicating the aggregated memory consumption. The train/val/test split can be defined based on the time sequence, with flexibility for forecasting tasks that analyze and predict resource usage trends over time.
